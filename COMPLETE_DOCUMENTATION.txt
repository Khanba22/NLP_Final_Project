3.5 EVALUATION METRICS EXPLAINED
---------------------------------

A) ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)

ROUGE-1 (Unigram Overlap)
   Calculation:
   - Count overlapping words between generated and reference
   - Precision = (overlapping words) / (words in generated)
   - Recall = (overlapping words) / (words in reference)
   - F1 = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
   
   Example:
   Reference: "The laptop has great battery life"
   Generated: "The laptop features excellent battery"
   Overlap: "The", "laptop", "battery" (3 words)
   ROUGE-1 Recall: 3/6 = 0.50
   ROUGE-1 Precision: 3/5 = 0.60
   ROUGE-1 F1: 0.545

ROUGE-2 (Bigram Overlap)
   Measures overlap of two-word phrases
   More strict than ROUGE-1
   Better for evaluating fluency

ROUGE-L (Longest Common Subsequence)
   Finds longest sequence of words in order
   Allows gaps between words
   Measures sentence-level structure similarity

B) BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)

Originally for machine translation, adapted for summarization

BLEU-1: Unigram precision
BLEU-2: Bigram precision
BLEU-4: Up to 4-gram precision

Calculation:
- Count n-gram matches
- Calculate precision for each n
- Multiply precisions and apply brevity penalty

   # Make request
   response = requests.post(
       "http://localhost:8000/technical-summarize",
       data={"text": product_text}
   )
   
   # Parse response
   result = response.json()
   print(f"Product: {result['product_name']}")
   print(f"Category: {result['category']}")
   print(f"Summary: {result['summary']}")
   print(f"Specs: {result['key_specs']}")
   ```

Example 2: Product Comparison
   ```python
   import requests
   
   products = [
       "Product 1 description...",
       "Product 2 description..."
   ]
   
   response = requests.post(
       "http://localhost:8000/compare-products",
       data={"texts": products}
   )
   
   result = response.json()
   print(f"Comparing {result['product_count']} products")
   print(f"Summary: {result['summary']}")
   ```

Example 3: Evaluation
   ```python
   import requests
   
   reference = "Original summary..."
   generated = "AI-generated summary..."
   
   response = requests.post(
       "http://localhost:8000/evaluate",
       data={
           "reference_text": reference,
           "generated_text": generated
       }
   )
   
   scores = response.json()['scores']
   print(f"ROUGE-1 F1: {scores['rouge1_fmeasure']:.4f}")
   print(f"BLEU-4: {scores['bleu4']:.4f}")
   ```

4.4 CUSTOMIZATION AND EXTENSION
--------------------------------

A) Adding New Product Categories
   Location: app/services/technical_summarizer.py
   Method: _determine_category()
   
   Add to categories dictionary:
   ```python
   categories = {
       'Laptop': ['laptop', 'notebook'],
       'Your_Category': ['keyword1', 'keyword2']
   }
   ```

B) Modifying Evaluation Metrics
   Location: app/evaluation/metrics.py
   Class: SummarizationEvaluator
   
   Add custom metric:
   ```python
   def evaluate_custom_metric(self, generated, reference):
       # Your metric calculation
       return score
   ```

C) Adding New Datasets
   Location: app/data/product_dataset.py
   
   Add product to sample data:
   ```python
   {
       "product_id": "new_001",
       "product_name": "Your Product",
       "category": "Category",
       "full_description": "...",
       "target_summary": {...}
   }
   ```

D) Changing the Model
   Location: app/services/technical_summarizer.py
   
   Modify initialization:
   ```python
   def __init__(self, model_name: str = "your-model-name"):
       # Load different model
   ```
   
   Compatible models:
   - facebook/bart-large-cnn (current)
   - t5-base
   - google/pegasus-xsum
   - Any Seq2Seq model from HuggingFace

4.5 TROUBLESHOOTING
-------------------

Issue 1: Model Download Slow
   Problem: First run downloads ~1.6GB model
   Solution: Be patient, only happens once
   Alternative: Pre-download model
   
Issue 2: Out of Memory
   Problem: Large texts cause memory issues
   Solution: Reduce batch size or max_length
   
Issue 3: Slow Inference
   Problem: CPU inference is slow
   Solution: Use GPU if available
   Check: torch.cuda.is_available()
   
Issue 4: Import Errors
   Problem: Missing dependencies
   Solution: pip install -r requirements.txt
   
Issue 5: NLTK Data Missing
   Problem: punkt or stopwords not found
   Solution: Run nltk.download() commands

4.6 PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
-----------------------------

A) Speed Improvements
   - Use GPU for inference (10-50x faster)
   - Reduce beam_search beams (4 → 2)
   - Lower max_length (200 → 128)
   - Batch multiple requests

B) Memory Optimization
   - Use quantization (8-bit or 4-bit)
   - Enable gradient checkpointing
   - Reduce batch size
   - Clear cache: torch.cuda.empty_cache()

C) Accuracy Improvements
   - Fine-tune on domain-specific data
   - Increase beam_search beams
   - Use larger models (bart-large → pegasus)
   - Ensemble multiple models

4.7 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
----------------------------

A) Input Validation
   - Maximum text length enforced
   - File type restrictions (PDF only)
   - File size limits
   - SQL injection prevention (not using SQL)

B) API Security
   - Add authentication (JWT tokens)
   - Rate limiting (prevent abuse)
   - CORS configuration (restrict origins)
   - HTTPS in production

C) Data Privacy
   - No data stored by default
   - Clear cache after processing
   - No logging of sensitive data
   - GDPR compliance ready
